# üëã My Windows Subsystem for Linux setup

It's not always possible to work on my preferred Operating System of choice, Linux. However, Windows now offers a mid-way point with WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux). WSL2 allows me to run a Linux environment directly on my Windows machine, providing the best of both worlds. One of the advantages of using WSL2 is improved performance on client machines that are heavily monitored by IT tools, which can often slow down the system. With WSL2, I can enjoy the benefits of Linux while still working within a Windows environment.

## Enable WSL 2 for Ubuntu-24.04

```bash
wsl --set-version Ubuntu-24.04 2
```

## Install Ubuntu 24.04

```bash
wsl --install -d Ubuntu-24.04
```

## ü§´ Add current user to `sudoers`

The sudo command in Linux allows users to execute commands with elevated privileges, typically as the root user. It is a powerful tool that grants users the ability to perform administrative tasks and make system-wide changes. However, it must be used with caution. Giving unrestricted sudo access to a user can potentially lead to unintended consequences, such as accidental modification or deletion of critical system files. It is important to carefully consider the level of access granted to users and ensure that only trusted individuals have sudo privileges. Additionally, it is recommended to log and monitor sudo activities to detect any unauthorized or malicious actions.

Controversial, but this is how I roll ü§∑

Execute the following to add the user to the `sudoers` group.

```bash
echo "$USER ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL" | sudo tee /etc/sudoers.d/$USER
```

```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

Next, we will be applying the `powerlevel10k` theme on top.

```bash
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k.git ~/powerlevel10k
echo 'source ~/powerlevel10k/powerlevel10k.zsh-theme' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

## üåîüöÄ Install `LunarVim`

LunarVim is an amazing editor that brings the power of Neovim to your fingertips. With LunarVim, you can work in the terminal with the same efficiency as any other GUI IDE. It provides a highly customizable and extensible environment, allowing you to tailor your editing experience to your specific needs. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, LunarVim offers a seamless and productive workflow, making it a top choice for many programmers.

First, we need `neovim`, the base.

```bash
curl -LO https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/latest/download/nvim-linux64.tar.gz
sudo rm -rf /opt/nvim
sudo tar -C /opt -xzf nvim-linux64.tar.gz
```

Add `neovim` to path. Open `~/.zshrc` in any file editor (e.g. `mcedit` or `vim`) and add the following at the end of the file

```bash
export PATH="$PATH:/opt/nvim-linux64/bin"
```

Re-source your shell

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

Check that `nvim` is available now.

![Installing neovim](img/install-neovim.gif)

</details>

Install `build-essential` tools.

```bash
sudo apt install build-essential
```

Install **LunarVim**. The install process will prompt you about addon choices. I typically choose to install nodejs dependencies and ignore others.

‚ö†Ô∏è Please pay attention to the following prompts during the installation process of LunarVim:

1. The installer will ask if you want to install NodeJS dependencies. Answer 'yes' to install them.
2. The installer may ask about other dependencies. Answer `no` to skip them.

```bash
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LunarVim/LunarVim/release-1.3/neovim-0.9/utils/installer/install.sh)
```

The installer will warn you that the `PATH` variable does not contain the newly created directory for `lvim`.

The output may be similar to this:

```bash
[WARN] the folder /home/karol/.local/bin is not on PATH, consider adding 'export PATH=/home/karol/.local/bin:$PATH'
```

Make sure you change your username from `karol` to whatever you're using. Add the following to the end of your `~/.zshrc`.

```bash
export PATH="/home/karol/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

Now, source the rc file and you will have access to `lvim`.

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

## Install ü™ü `tmux`

tmux is a powerful terminal multiplexer that allows you to manage multiple terminal sessions within a single window. It provides a wayy to create, organize, and switch between multiple terminal sessions, making it easier to work on different tasks simultaneously. With tmux, you can split your terminal window into multiple panes, detach and reattach sessions, and even share sessions with other users.

To install tmux, you can use the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install tmux -y
```

Next, we will be modifying the default key bindings.

Create a `.tmux.conf` file under your user directory

```bash
touch ~/.tmux.conf
```

Edit the `~/.tmux.conf` file and add the following to set it up:

```sh
set -g default-terminal "screen-256color"

set -g prefix C-a
unbind C-b

bind-key C-a send-prefix

unbind %
bind | split-window -h

unbind '"'
bind - split-window -v

unbind r
bind r source-file ~/.tmux.conf

set -g mouse on
```

Save the `~/.tmux.conf` file and you can now use the `tmux` multiplexer.
